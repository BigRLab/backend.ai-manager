0.5.1 (2016-11-15)
------------------

**FIXES**

 - Added a missing check for stale kernel sessions due to restarts of Sorna agents.
   This bug has impacted public tutorial/workshops and demonstrations because the
   manager does not recreate kernels at the right timing.

------------------

**NEW**

 - First public release.
